-- DESCRIPTION:
--   Checks all bingo cards for a given game to find any card
--   where ALL 25 squares have been called. This is the
--   "Blackout" or "Full Card" bingo variant — every single
--   square on the card must be marked, including the FREE
--   space at N3 which is always pre-called.
--
--   If winners are found, all qualifying cards are auto-flagged,
--   the Game record is updated to Complete, and all winner
--   details are returned. If no card is fully called yet,
--   a 'No winner yet' result is returned and the game continues.
--
-- PARAMETERS:
--   @Game_ID        INT  -- The Game to check. Must exist in
--                        -- the Game table.
--
-- HOW IT WORKS:
--   A single WHERE clause checks that all 25 squares on each
--   card are flagged as Called = 1. No CROSS APPLY needed —
--   there is only one pattern to evaluate (the full card).
--
--   All 25 squares checked:
--
--     Col B : Sq_B1, Sq_B2, Sq_B3, Sq_B4, Sq_B5
--     Col I : Sq_I1, Sq_I2, Sq_I3, Sq_I4, Sq_I5
--     Col N : Sq_N1, Sq_N2, Sq_N3(FREE), Sq_N4, Sq_N5
--     Col G : Sq_G1, Sq_G2, Sq_G3, Sq_G4, Sq_G5
--     Col O : Sq_O1, Sq_O2, Sq_O3, Sq_O4, Sq_O5

--
-- FREE SPACE NOTE:
--   Sq_N3_Called is always 1 (FREE SPACE). It counts as called
--   for the Blackout pattern so only 24 songs need to match
--   the remaining squares on any given card to achieve a
--   Blackout. In practice this variant runs the full game
--   almost to completion before a winner emerges.
--
-- WHAT IT AUTO-FLAGS ON A WIN:
--   Cards table:
--     - Card_IsWinner set to 1 on ALL qualifying cards
--
--   Game table:
--     - Game_WinnerCard_ID set to the lowest qualifying Card_ID
--     - Game_Status set to 'Complete'
--     - Game_EndTime stamped with SYSDATETIME()
--
-- USAGE:
--   -- Call after every usp_CallSong execution as a Blackout variant:
--   EXEC dbo.usp_CallSong                  @Game_ID = 1, @Song_ID = 42;
--   EXEC dbo.usp_CheckForWinner_Blackout   @Game_ID = 1;
--
-- RETURNS:
--   One row per winning card:
--     - Game_ID           : The game that was checked
--     - Winning_Card_ID   : Card_ID of the winner
--     - Winning_Pattern   : Always 'Blackout' for this proc
--     - Player_Name       : Card_PlayerName
--     - Player_Email      : Card_PlayerEmail
--     - Result            : 'BINGO! Blackout!' or 'No winner yet'
--
-- GAME LOOP THIS PROC BELONGS TO:
--   1. usp_GenerateBingoCards          -- Generate 200 cards for a game
--   2. usp_CallSong                    -- DJ plays a song, flip Called flags
--   3. usp_CheckForWinner_Blackout     -- Check all cards for full blackout
--   4. usp_ResetGame                   -- Reset and replay with same cards
--
-- RELATED PROCEDURES:
--   usp_CheckForWinner            -- Standard single-line winner check
--   usp_CheckForWinner_2Line      -- Requires 2 completed lines to win
--   usp_CheckForWinner_4Corners   -- All 4 corner squares must be called
--   usp_CheckForWinner_Blackout   -- This proc; every square must be called
--
-- ERROR CONDITIONS:
--   - @Game_ID not found : Raises error 16, nothing changes

--A few notes specific to this one:

--All 25 squares explicit — every square is listed individually, grouped by column with comments, so it's immediately clear what's being checked and nothing can accidentally be missed.
--FREE space comment on N3 — called out inline at the Sq_N3_Called line as a reminder that it's always 1, meaning a true Blackout only needs 24 actual song calls to land on a given card.
--No CROSS APPLY, no aggregation — like the 4 Corners proc, a single WHERE clause is all that's needed. Keeping it simple makes it the fastest of the four procs to execute.
--Consistent result set shape — same columns as all three sibling procs so your front end or DJ dashboard can call any of the four variants and handle the response identically.
